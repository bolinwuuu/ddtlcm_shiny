# ddtlcm_shiny

We provide an accompanying Shiny app with point-and-click interactivity to allow visualization and exploration of model results. 
The app, available at [https://bolinw.shinyapps.io/ddtlcm_app/](https://bolinw.shinyapps.io/ddtlcm_app/), is designed with three modes, allowing users to 

  1) simulate data using user-specified parameters or exemplar parameters mimicking a real data set,
  2) upload raw multivariate binary observed data, or 3) upload posterior samples collected from a completed fit of the DDT-LCM. Users can explore the app to fully un- derstand the properties of the model, analyze their own data, save the fitted results, and produce visualizations.



The backend R package can be found on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ddtlcm/index.html) or [GitHub (development version)](https://github.com/limengbinggz/ddtlcm).

A short software paper describing the model features and functionalities can be found [here](https://github.com/limengbinggz/ddtlcm/blob/main/JOSS/paper.pdf).
